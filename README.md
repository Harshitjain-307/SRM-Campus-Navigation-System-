# Campus Navigation System

## Problem Statement
Navigating a large campus can be confusing for students, visitors, and staff. Generic maps, like Google Maps, don’t offer customized indoor and outdoor navigation for campuses, including hostels, classrooms, labs, and cafeterias.

Our goal is to create a smart campus navigation system that makes it easy and interactive to move around campus.

## Current Progress
✅ Interactive campus map using React and Reflet HTML map  
✅ Search box for hostels and buildings  
✅ Blue route visualization on search  
✅ Smooth animations with Framer Motion  
✅ Modern user interface designed with Tailwind CSS  

Pending Work:
- Improve map accuracy with better coordinates  
- Add multi-floor navigation for stairs and elevators  
- Enable real-time location tracking using GPS and Bluetooth beacons  
- Develop an AI-powered chatbot assistant for navigation questions  
- Create augmented reality overlays for live directions  
- Integrate with Node.js backend APIs for data and analytics  
- Optimize for mobile use using PWA or React Native

## How the Prototype Solves the Problem
- Users can search for any location, such as “Hostel A,” “CSE Block,” or “Library.”  
- The system shows the best route highlighted with a blue line on the map.  
- It offers a smooth user experience powered by Framer Motion animations.  
- It is campus-specific, unlike generic navigation apps.  

### Planned Technologies
- AI and machine learning for path optimization, suggesting the shortest or fastest routes based on crowd density and distance  
- Augmented reality navigation, allowing users to hold up their phones to see real-time arrows guiding them on campus  
- Voice assistant that takes commands like “Hey, take me to Hostel B” and provides guided directions  
- Integration with IoT, connecting to smart sensors, such as beacons for indoor positioning  
- Data analytics to track foot traffic in different areas to optimize campus resources  
- Offline mode with cached maps for users without internet access
